## 📘 Overview

This project implements a **yarn quality prediction system** using machine learning, serving as a critical component for **Cotton Blending Cost-Quality Optimization (CBCQO)**. 

The system predicts 7 yarn quality properties from cotton blend characteristics using an ensemble approach combining **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** regressors.

### 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Yarn Quality Prediction** - Accurately predict yarn properties from cotton blends
2. **Cost-Quality Optimization** - Enable intelligent cotton blending decisions
3. **Industrial Application** - Support textile manufacturers in optimizing production costs while maintaining quality

---

## 🔬 Research Context

This implementation is based on research in intelligent cotton blending optimization:

**Paper Reference:**
> Wang, M., Wang, J., & Gao, W. (2025). *"Towards large-scale cotton blending optimization: dual-pheromone crossover ant colony algorithm with expert heuristic cognition"*. Advanced Engineering Informatics, 68, 103657.

### The Cotton Blending Problem

**Challenge:** Textile mills have 200+ cotton types with varying properties and prices. Finding the optimal blend that minimizes cost while meeting yarn quality requirements is computationally intensive.

**Solution Framework:**
```
Cotton Properties → Prediction Model → Yarn Quality
                         ↓                  ↓
                    (This Project)    Quality Check
                         ↓                  ↓
                Optimization Algorithm → Optimal Blend
                    (DPX-ACO)              (Min Cost)
```

**This project provides the prediction model component** that evaluates yarn quality during the optimization process.

## 🤖 Model Architecture

### Ensemble Approach: RF + GB

This project uses **two complementary ensemble models**:

#### 1️⃣ Random Forest Regressor
**Concept:** "Wisdom of the crowd" - 300 decision trees vote on predictions

```python
Configuration:
- n_estimators: 300 trees
- max_depth: 20 levels
- Strategy: Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
```

**Strengths:**
- Robust against overfitting
- Handles feature interactions
- Stable predictions

#### 2️⃣ Gradient Boosting Regressor
**Concept:** "Learning from mistakes" - Sequential error correction

```python
Configuration:
- n_estimators: 250 trees
- learning_rate: 0.05
- max_depth: 5 levels
- Strategy: Boosting (Iterative refinement)
```

**Strengths:**
- High accuracy
- Captures complex patterns
- Reduces bias

#### 3️⃣ Ensemble Fusion
```python
Final Prediction = (RF Prediction + GB Prediction) / 2
```

**Benefits:**
- RF provides stability (variance reduction)
- GB provides accuracy (bias reduction)
- Combined ensemble balances both

## 📈 Model Performance

### Results Summary

| Yarn Property | R² Score | MAE | Performance |
|---------------|----------|-----|-------------|
| **yarn_hairiness** | **0.808** | 0.041 | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| **yarn_elongation** | **0.798** | 0.122 | ⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| **yarn_neps** | **0.708** | 12.12 | ⭐⭐ Good |
| **yarn_strength** | 0.663 | 0.164 | ⭐⭐ Good |
| **yarn_cv** | 0.394 | 0.199 | ⭐ Fair |
| **yarn_thin_places** | 0.002 | 3.91 | ❌ Poor |
| **yarn_thick_places** | -0.007 | 7.86 | ❌ Poor |

**Average R²:** 0.48

### Performance Analysis

**✅ Strengths:**
- Excellent predictions for hairiness, elongation, and neps (R² > 0.70)
- Fast inference (<1ms per prediction)
- Works well with 10,000 samples
- CPU-only deployment

**⚠️ Limitations:**
- Poor performance on irregularities (thin/thick places)
- Separate models for each property (no cross-property learning)
- Limited nonlinear modeling capacity

**💡 Why Irregularities Failed:**
Thin and thick places are governed by highly complex, nonlinear spinning physics that tree-based models cannot adequately capture. Deep learning models (e.g., Transformers) show significant improvement on these properties.

## 🔄 Integration with Optimization

### Role in CBCQO Framework

This prediction model serves as the **evaluation function** in the cotton blending optimization loop:

```
DPX-ACO Optimization Process:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ For each iteration (100 total):    │
│   For each ant (50 ants):          │
│     1. Select cotton types          │
│     2. Allocate packages            │
│     3. → PREDICT QUALITY ← (This)   │ 
│     4. Calculate cost               │
│     5. Check constraints            │
│     6. Update pheromones            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Total predictions: 50 × 100 = 5,000 per run
Speed requirement: <5 seconds total
```

**Performance Impact:**
- **Traditional ML (This project):** 5,000 predictions in ~5 seconds ✓
- **Deep Learning alternative:** 5,000 predictions in ~25 seconds

### Cost-Quality Trade-off

The model enables optimization to balance:

```
Objective Function: Minimize (Cost + Quality Penalty)

Cost = Σ(cotton_price × blending_ratio)
Quality Penalty = 100 × (number of violated constraints)

Goal: Find minimum cost blend where all quality requirements are met
```
