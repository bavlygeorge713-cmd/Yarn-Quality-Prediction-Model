# Yarn-Quality-Prediction-Model
Machine Learning Model for Yarn Quality Prediction This project uses Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors to predict yarn properties (strength, elongation, CV, thin/thick places, neps, and hairiness) based on cotton blend data. It includes data preprocessing, scaling, model training, and ensemble averaging for improved accuracy.
